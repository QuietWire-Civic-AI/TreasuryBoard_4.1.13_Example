## Civic Narrative Assurance – Madrid Pilot Brief (v1.0)

**QuietWire × DISARM+ × Alto Intelligence × CAP (Civic Attestation Platform)**
**Date:** October 2025   **Location:** Madrid, Spain

---

### 1. Purpose

To launch the first **Civic Narrative Assurance** pilot integrating:

* **DISARM+**: threat-simulation and decision-resilience training.
* **QuietWire / CAP / LuminaOS**: civic attestation, AI companion, and semantic integrity stack.
* **Alto Intelligence (Spain)** and **Carlos Castaneda (Colombia)**: regional partners linking the financial and civic-security domains.

This pilot will demonstrate how **financial institutions and regulators** can use attested, explainable AI support to strengthen trust, detect manipulation, and improve decision discipline under narrative stress.

### 2. Objectives

| Strategic                                                                                             | Operational                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Establish Madrid as the **first Civic Narrative Assurance Node** connecting Europe and Latin America. | Conduct a **1.5-day TTX** (tabletop exercise) simulating a financial disinformation crisis.  |
| Validate integration of **LuminaOS + CAP** inside a live DISARM+ exercise.                            | Capture **attested decision logs** for post-exercise analysis and regulatory benchmarking.   |
| Position **QuietWire and DISARM** as global partners in ethical, civic-grade AI assurance.            | Produce a replicable **Civic AI Pilot Template** for future sites (Ottawa, Bogotá, Toronto). |

### 3. Participants

* **DISARM.Foundation** – Training design, facilitation, and threat-framework authority.
* **QuietWire / LuminaOS** – Civic AI architecture, attestation stack, and semantic analytics.
* **Civic Attestation Platform (CAP)** – Proof-of-process layer generating cryptographic attestations of decisions and narrative deltas.
* **Alto Intelligence (Madrid)** – Financial-sector analytics and LatAm network hub.
* **Carlos Castaneda** – Strategic partner bridging defense, academic, and civic institutions in Colombia.
* **Observer/Partners:** Finance Canada (Treasury Board 4.1.13), Inter-Americas Bank (IDB), selected Spanish and Colombian financial entities.

### 4. Scenario Concept

**“The Silent Bank Run”** – a synthetic influence campaign spreads a false liquidity-risk rumor across social media and encrypted channels.
Teams (Bank A, Regulator, Media Monitor, Civic Responder) work through escalation, verification, and communication decisions while **Lumina (Civic AI Companion)** captures reasoning chains and **CAP** signs each action for transparency.

**Outputs:**

* Live attestation ledger
* Cognitive-load & narrative-drift analytics
* After-Action Report within 30 days

*Data Flow:* dialogue → semantic log → attestation → canonical archive
*Governance:* CAP rule-sets define civic and ethical boundaries; logs remain auditable but privacy-protected.
