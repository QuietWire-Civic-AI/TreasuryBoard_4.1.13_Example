# Policy Basics (Directive 4.1.13)

This example repository demonstrates one practical way to satisfy 4.1.13 by:
- maintaining an intake and tagging process;
- using a shared taxonomy (DISARM) to reason about incidents;
- documenting roles, thresholds, and playbooks;
- validating configuration and reporting routine metrics.

This doc intentionally avoids organization-specific details to remain a generic, forkable template.
