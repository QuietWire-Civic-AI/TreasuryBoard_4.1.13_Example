# Playbook 00 — Intake

**Goal:** consistent capture of reports/events.

1. Confirm source & timestamp; archive URLs and screenshots.
2. Open an incident record (GitHub Issue or internal ticket).
3. Save raw evidence under controlled storage.
4. If clear harm/immediacy → notify on-call per `configs/department.yaml`.
Artifacts: intake ticket, evidence links.
